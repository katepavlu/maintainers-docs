# Installers structure
Each installer is a set of instructions and these are saved in manifests 
(YAML files) which are interpreted by Bottles. For this it is important that 
the structure of these is correct, otherwise Bottles will not be able to 
process them.

## Manifest
Like [Dependencies](/dependencies/structure) each manifest has two parts:
- header
- steps

### Header
The header is the first part of the manifest, it contains the metadata of the
installer and its dependencies if any.

The header must provide the following keys:
- `Name`: the name of the installer, it must be unique and normally it is the
  same as the name of main download file
- `Description`: this is a small description of the installer (e.g. for
  epicgamestore it is "The official Epic Games launcher.")
- `Grade`: the grade of compatibility of the installer (Bronze, Silver, Gold, 
  Platinum). If you don't know what grade to give a program, select Bronze.
- `Arch`: the architecture of the bottle (win32, win64)
- `Dependencies`: a list of dependencies that this installer depends on
- `Parameters`: a list of parameters to be set in the bottle configuration
- `Executable`: the entry to be added to the bottle Programs list, can be
  used to configure arguments and other things

These keys are used by Bottles to show the installer in the Installers view
and handle its requirements before proceeding with the installation. Let's see
an example:

```yaml
Name: epicgamestore
Description: The official Epic Games launcher.
Grade: Platinum
Arch: win64

Dependencies:
- d3dx9
- msls31
- riched20
- allfonts
- d3dcompiler_43
- d3dcompiler_47
- vcredist2015

Parameters:
  dxvk: true
  sync: esync
  discrete_gpu: true
  
Executable:
  name: Epic Games Store
  icon: epicgamestore.svg
  file: EpicGamesLauncher.exe
  path: Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32/EpicGamesLauncher.exe
  arguments: -opengl -SkipBuildPatchPrereq
  
Steps:
- action: install_msi
  file_name: EpicGamesLauncherInstaller.msi
  url: https://cdn.usebottles.com/programs/EpicGamesLauncherInstaller.msi
  file_checksum: ebde67191bc1a483fd821daf8e01ce46
  arguments: /q

Checks:
  files:
    - Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32/EpicGamesLauncher.exe
```

In this example, the installer is named `epicgamestore`, the grade is `Platinum`, the
needed bottle arch is `win64` and it depends on the following dependencies:
- d3dx9
- msls31
- riched20
- allfonts
- d3dcompiler_43
- d3dcompiler_47
- vcredist2015

It also has the following parameters:
- `dxvk`: set to `true` to enable DXVK
- `esync`: set to `true` to switch to the Esync syncrhonization
- `discrete_gpu`: set to `true` to enable discrete GPU if available

Finally it configure the `Executable` and add a new entry in the bottle 
programs list. The `path` key also support the `userdir/` placeholder, which
will be automatically replaced by Bottles using the right user path, so use
this if the executable is placed in the user directory (e.g. 
`drive_c/users/john/AppData/Program/Program.exe`).

This installer came with an optional `Checks` key, which can be used to look
for one or more files, to ensure the installation was ended successfully.

### Steps
Like dependencies, each installer has a set of steps that must be executed
in order to install the software. Each step define an action type and a set
of parameters.

**Note:** the steps are executed in the order they are listed in the manifest,
so be careful when you add a new one, if your new step depends on the previous
one, you should add it after the previous one.

### Comments
Despite YAML is a simple language and our installer syntax is very simple and
should be very easy to read, it is still possible to write comments in the
manifest to explain what is going on or why it is needed:

```yaml
